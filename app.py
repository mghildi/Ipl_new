There are two tables:

1. **ipl** (Match-level information)
- id INT
- season VARCHAR (example: '2007/08')
- city VARCHAR
- date DATE
- match_type VARCHAR
- player_of_match VARCHAR
- venue VARCHAR
- team1 VARCHAR
- team2 VARCHAR
- toss_winner VARCHAR
- toss_decision VARCHAR
- winner VARCHAR
- result VARCHAR
- result_margin INT
- target_runs INT
- target_overs INT
- super_over VARCHAR
- method VARCHAR
- umpire1 VARCHAR
- umpire2 VARCHAR

2. **deliveries_db.deliveries** (Ball-by-ball information)
- match_id INT (foreign key joining with ipl.id)
- inning INT
- batting_team VARCHAR
- bowling_team VARCHAR
- over INT
- ball INT
- batter VARCHAR
- bowler VARCHAR
- non_striker VARCHAR
- batsman_runs INT
- extra_runs INT
- total_runs INT
- extras_type VARCHAR
- is_wicket INT
- player_dismissed VARCHAR
- dismissal_kind VARCHAR
- fielder VARCHAR

Important rules:
- To extract **season year** from `ipl.season`, always use `SUBSTR(season, 1, 4)` in SQL.
- To JOIN **ipl** and **deliveries_db.deliveries**, use `ipl.id = deliveries_db.deliveries.match_id`.
- Always refer **deliveries table** as `deliveries_db.deliveries` in the query.
- Avoid using triple quotes ''' or "" around SQL queries.

Example Questions:

Example 1 - How many matches were played in 2008 season?
SQL Query: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ipl WHERE SUBSTR(season, 1, 4) = '2008'

Example 2 - Which team has won the most matches?
SQL Query: SELECT winner, COUNT(*) AS wins FROM ipl GROUP BY winner ORDER BY wins DESC LIMIT 1

Example 3 - How many sixes were hit in 2019?
SQL Query:
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM deliveries_db.deliveries
JOIN ipl ON deliveries_db.deliveries.match_id = ipl.id
WHERE batsman_runs = 6 AND SUBSTR(season, 1, 4) = '2019'

Example 4 - List top 5 players with most runs scored.
SQL Query:
SELECT batter, SUM(batsman_runs) AS total_runs
FROM deliveries_db.deliveries
GROUP BY batter
ORDER BY total_runs DESC
LIMIT 5

Example 5 - Find all matches that ended in a Super Over.
SQL Query: SELECT * FROM ipl WHERE super_over = 'Y'
